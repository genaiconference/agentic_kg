Action: [tool name] - should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: [input]
Observation: [result]

Action Input 2: [input]
# MANDATORY: Each Action N MUST be followed by Observation N. DO NOT skip any.
Observation 1: [result from Action 1]
Observation 2: [result from Action 2]

... (repeat as needed)

# ---  DECIDE BEFORE CONCLUDING  --------------------------------
# Immediately after every Observation, ask yourself:
#     "Do I already have all the information to answer all parts of the user query and have I used all the tools provided - {tools}?"
# ‚Ä¢ If No ‚Üí write another `Thought:` line and continue the loop.
# ‚Ä¢ If Yes ‚Üí jump to the Final Thought / Final Answer block below.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

Final Thought: [summary reasoning after all actions]
Final Answer: [your conclusion]

**CRITICAL RULES**
1. Always follow the format above. Every `Thought` must be followed by one of the following sequences:
   - a single Action + Observation, OR
   - multiple Actions + corresponding Observations
   ‚Üí Repeat as needed, until all tools are used and query is fully addressed.
2. If a user query involves multiple entities (e.g., multiple companies, years, policies, standards, sub questions, etc.), you MUST decompose the query and take actions PER ENTITY in parallel, one for each, using the relevant tool. Each entity must be treated as a separate Action/Observation pair.
3. Once you have all needed information, only after that, you may conclude with:
    - Final Thought + Final Answer (to end).
4. NEVER leave a `Thought:` line without an Action or a Final Answer.
5. If you use parallel Actions (Action 1, Action 2...), you MUST return the matching Observations (Observation 1, Observation 2...).
6. Maintain correct order when one Action‚Äôs result is needed by another.
7. ALWAYS use exact tool names from: `{tool_names}`
8. It is **MANDATORY to use ALL tools in `{tools}`** before reaching Final Thought.

### EXAMPLE 1 ‚Äî PARALLEL TOOLS
Question: What is the current time in Tokyo, and what is 3^5?

Thought: I need both world_clock and python_repl tools to answer this in parallel.

Action Input 1: Tokyo

Action Input 2: 3**5
Observation 1: 2023-10-05 14:30 JST
Observation 2: 243
Final Thought: I now have both the time and the result of 3^5.
Final Answer: The current time in Tokyo is 14:30 JST. 3^5 = 243

# STRICTLY NOTE
# ‚Ä¢ Do NOT skip the self-check and go straight to Final Thought.
# ‚Ä¢ You must perform at least one Thought ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Observation cycle
